Getting Started with YakIO C++ Bare metal Programming for the BBC microbit

This is a set of quick "Get You Started" instructions. The information in
this file is discussed in greater detail the aaReadMe.txt file in the 
YakIO sub-directory and also in the aaReadMe.txt files in each of the example
directories.

You use the YakIO library and example code entirely at your own risk! 
See the disclaimers on the home page, in the code and in each aaReadMe.txt
file.

0) This branch of the YakIO Library is only for the BBC microbit V1. It
   will NOT work on the V2 version. The V2 uses a different CPU and there 
   are significant differences.

1) These instructions assume you are running on a Windows 10 or 11 system.
   If that is not the case, see the aaReadMe.txt files for more information.

2) You need a cross-compiler. The one used for development was the Windows 
   installer below. There are later versions, but this was the one used 
   for development.
     
        gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q2-20150609-win32.exe 
        
     available from the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain website
     
        https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download
        
3) The arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe compiler and arm-none-eabi-objcopy.exe 
   converter from step 2 should be on the path. If you get it right, the following 
   command should always work from the Windows command prompt or powershell:
     
   > arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe --version
     
        arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 4.9.3 20150529 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_9-branch revision 224288]
        Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

4) There is a suite of example code. These are in directories starting with 
   digits (like 01_, 02_ etc). The YakIO library is in the YakIO directory.
   
5) Each example directory has an aaReadMe.txt file which explains what the 
   example code does. You really should read this file. Each is specific to 
   the example code in that directory - they are not all the same.
   
6) The examples form a kind of tutorial on how to use the YakIO library. It
   is suggested that you review each one in order. The information presented 
   is cumulative - concepts that are discussed in a particular example may be 
   used in later examples without much discussion. 
      
7) The example directories should be at the same level as the YakIO library. 

         SomeDir
           |
           YakIO_for_microbitV1
             |
             | YakIO
             |   | Include
             |   | Objects              
             |   | Source              
             |
             | 01_Blinky
             | 02_BetterBlinky
             | 03_Danger
             | ..... 
             
8) Review the aaReadMe.txt, Main.cpp and Main.h files in the 01_Blinky 
   example directory in order to understand what that example code does.
   
9) If you have downloaded this source from the GitHub Repo, all of the examples
   should already be built. You can just copy the existing .hex file onto 
   your microbit and have it run.
                
10)Open a windows command or powershell terminal at the top of the example
   directory you are interested in. Run the CompileProgram.bat command. 
   This will compile up a new .hex file in that directory for you. Drag 
   the .hex file onto the microbit to see it execute.
   
11)You are now bare metal programming the BBC microbit in C++. Good Luck.
