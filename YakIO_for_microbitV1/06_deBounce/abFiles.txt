The 06_deBounce Example File List

YakIO is an open source library and example compilation toolchain which 
is intended to enable the creation C++ programs for the BBC micro:bit
microcontroller.

List of Files in the 06_deBounce example directory and what they do:

aaReadMe.txt        - a file containing information about the 06_deBounce
                      example code. You SHOULD read this file. The examples
                      actually form a sequential tutorial on how to use
                      the YakIO library. This file discusses the purpose
                      of the 06_deBounce example and provides a list 
                      of the techniques demonstrated in it that you might
                      wish to look out for. 
                      
abFiles.txt         - this file

CompileProgram.bat  - a Windows batch script to compile up a user program
                      and link it with the YakIO object files. See the 
                      comments in this file for more information.
                                            
Main.cpp            - Contains the member functions of the Main class. This
                      is part of the code the user edits and forms the user 
                      written part of the program.
                      
Main.h              - Contains the definitions of the Main class. This
                      is part of the code the user edits and forms the user 
                      written part of the program.
                      
program.cpp         - A file containing some connecting code that is the 
                      first thing called by the YakIO library. It 
                      instantiates and launches the main class of the 
                      user written software. Not normally user editable.
